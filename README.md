UI Framework

## Prior Art

- **Heavily** based off [Vide](https://github.com/centau/vide/), which is based off [solidjs](https://github.com/solidjs/solid). This project started as a Vide fork.
  - Vide was used as reference for implementing the reactive graph functions
- Utilizes Alice's [hybrid push-pull reactive graph](https://gist.github.com/alicesaidhi/32f5bd225932a5d0239d0798c3d2e292) (based off Vide's reactive graph)
- Animation, time & color utilities inspired by [Fusion](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion).
